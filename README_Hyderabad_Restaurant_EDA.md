# 🍽️ Exploratory Data Analysis on Hyderabad Restaurant Data | EazyDiner Scraping

This project combines **Web Scraping** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on restaurant listings from [EazyDiner](https://www.eazydiner.com/hyderabad/restaurants). We collected real-time lunch listings in Hyderabad, cleaned and visualized the data to uncover trends in pricing, meal types, ratings, and offers.
